### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 121642 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 🐣 says they 👍 my latest blog post: **[Digital resilience: redundancy for websites and communications](https://victoria.dev/blog/digital-resilience-redundancy-for-websites-and-communications/)**.
