### Hello! Iâ€™m Victoria Drake. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer at ðŸ’œ and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 97104 words Iâ€™ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

I spent summers as a kid hacking Neopets and coding a medieval multiplayer role play world through a teeny tiny terminal window. Sometime before that, I wrote mystery novels and lived a secret life as a super sleuth.
