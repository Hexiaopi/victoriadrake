### Hello! Iâ€™m Victoria Drake. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer at ðŸ’œ and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 113250 words Iâ€™ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This ðŸ¦” says they ðŸŽ‰ my latest blog post: **[Be brave and build in public](https://victoria.dev/blog/be-brave-and-build-in-public/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [ðŸ“¡ **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml) or by email at [**victoria.dev**](https://victoria.dev).
