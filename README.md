### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 102936 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 🐣 says they 🎉 my latest blog post: **[Three rules for choosing a VPN that takes your privacy seriously](https://victoria.dev/blog/three-rules-for-choosing-a-vpn-that-takes-your-privacy-seriously/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [📡 **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml).
