### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 115669 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 🦊 says they 👍 my latest blog post: **[How to get hired as a software developer](https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-get-hired-as-a-software-developer/)**.
