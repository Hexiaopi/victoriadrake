### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 107381 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 🥑 says they 👍 my latest blog post: **[Make your website effortlessly browse-able with clever CSS](https://victoria.dev/blog/make-your-website-effortlessly-browse-able-with-clever-css/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [📡 **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml).
