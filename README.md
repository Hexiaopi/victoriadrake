### Hello! Iâ€™m Victoria Drake. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer at ðŸ’œ and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 105297 words Iâ€™ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This ðŸ’© says they ðŸ¤· my latest blog post: **[WPA Key, WPA2, WPA3, and WEP Key: Wi-Fi security explained](https://victoria.dev/blog/wpa-key-wpa2-wpa3-and-wep-key-wi-fi-security-explained/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [ðŸ“¡ **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml).
