### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake.

I lead software development teams in the cybersecurity industry and still enjoy getting hands-on with code in the open source world. I build my skill stack in public through the 123647 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to empower people to learn openly and fearlessly through knowledge sharing and technology leadership.
