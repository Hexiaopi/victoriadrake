### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 95602 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

I spent summers as a kid hacking Neopets and coding a medieval multiplayer role play world through a teeny tiny terminal window. Sometime before that, I wrote mystery novels and lived a secret life as a super sleuth.
