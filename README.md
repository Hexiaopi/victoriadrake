### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 108779 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 💩 says they 👏 my latest blog post: **[OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4.2 released](https://victoria.dev/blog/owasp-web-security-testing-guide-v4.2-released/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [📡 **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml).
